# Basic-Banking-System
Web Development Task by The Sparks Foundation to make a Basic Banking System. I have created this project to transfer money between dummy users. The frontend has been achieved by-HTML and CSS. For backend I have used- C# and the Database used includes- MySQL. This is a simple dynamic website to transfer money between multiple users and check the credits. 
The flow of the website is:
Home Page > View all Customers > Select and View one Customer > Transfer Money > Select customer to transfer money to > View all Customers.
